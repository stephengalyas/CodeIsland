 * This is the "god" script for the Goblin.
 * This class will contain all public variables that may be accessed throughout the game, such as booleans to track the character's progress and the score.
 * Depends on GobCollisionHandler, GobMovement, and GobDialogueManager.
 * 
 * Currently, this class is empty.
