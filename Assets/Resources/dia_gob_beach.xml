<goblin>

		<body>Hey, you! I've never seen you around the island before. Welcome to Code Island!</body>
		<body>I saw your ship get destroyed out at sea. It's a miracle you were able to swim to shore.</body>
		<body>Code Island is a pretty cool place. There are many areas of the island to explore and plenty of people to meet!</body>
		<body>However, we have been experiencing some problems with bugs on the island . . . Ahh, don't worry about it.</body>
		<body>Follow the path to discover what lies ahead!</body>

		<body>The beach is beautiful, isn't it? I love feeling the sun on my skin.</body>
		<body>See that path over there? Every person who has walked on it has had their life changed.</body>
		<body>Do not be afraid! Great things lie ahead.</body>
